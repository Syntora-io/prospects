# Discovery Call - Bear Property Management
**Date:** 2026-02-23, 11:00am CT
**Attendees:** Parker Gawne, Meghna Shindhe, Sara Luster
**Missing:** Jenny Armor (couldn't make it, will join March 4 call)

## Key Corrections from Pre-Call Research
- LIHTC properties are on **RealPage**, NOT AppFolio
- AppFolio is only for commercial side (3 legacy market-rate properties)
- Jenny Armor (not "J. Armer") -- Asset Manager, jarmer@bearreg.com

## Scale
- 26 LIHTC communities currently managed
- 4 in lease-up right now
- 7 more in the pipeline
- Big growth year, especially Madison region
- Staffing challenges in Madison

## Core List Example (576 units, Milwaukee)
- 576 units, coming online 72 at a time (building by building through 2026)
- 7 people on application review for this one property
- 1 admin: 40+ hrs/week just opening, sorting, bucketing applications
- 2 leasing agents: following up with sorted leads, scheduling group tours
- 2 assistant managers: normal management duties (delinquency, resident mgmt)
- Group tours because volume is too high for 1-on-1
- Denying 4-5 applications for every 1 accepted
- High decline rate on credit/background AND over/under income

## Madison -- Opposite Problem
- Not enough leads coming in
- Needs staff out doing marketing, meeting partners
- If the sorting problem is solved, those staff can redirect to lead gen

## Income Calculation Process (Manual)
- All income sources count: employment, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime, child support, Social Security, disability, divorce decree income, even informal support ("baby daddy buying diapers")
- Tax credit is FORWARD-LOOKING: anticipate income over NEXT 12 months (not past 12 like HUD)
- If tips/commissions/bonuses appear on pay stubs, must call employer back and ask: "What do you anticipate they'll earn in the next 12 months?"
- Hourly income: multiply by 2080 = annual income
- Assets over $5,000: must verify
- Assets under $5,000 with HOME program layering: verify anyway
- HOME units also require student status verification
- Varies by site depending on program layering

## RealPage Workflow (Current State)
1. Applicant fills out online application in RealPage
2. RealPage dumps application into a generic waiting list bucket
3. Someone manually opens each application
4. Manual income calculation -- quick hand calc based on what applicant entered
5. Determine AMI bucket (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%)
6. Either assign to a unit or place on waiting list
7. Waiting list only holds applications for 90 days before requiring manual action
8. RealPage CANNOT sort waiting list by AMI
9. Team manually annotates AMI category next to applicant name (e.g., "40", "50")
10. When filling a unit, they sort by annotation and work top-down

## What RealPage Can't Do
- Cannot auto-calculate income from application data
- Cannot auto-assign AMI bucket
- Cannot sort waiting list by AMI
- Cannot auto-communicate status to applicants
- Online leasing for tax credit is new (post-COVID, state monitoring agencies just started allowing it)

## Screening
- Credit/background check via separate screening provider -- "pretty dialed in"
- Rental verification also handled
- This part is NOT the pain point

## Competition / Market Context
- RealPage and Yardi are the big two in multifamily
- RealPage preferred for affordable housing workflows and budgeting
- RealPage charges extra for every integration
- Pay Score and Snapt already have RealPage integrations doing similar things
- Companies either eat the integration fee or pass it on

## Sara's Magic Wand Answer
**Waiting list sorting into AMI buckets.** That's the #1 priority.

## Secondary Priority
- Automated communication to applicants: "We received your application, based on info provided you may qualify for X, you've been added to waiting list / someone will reach out"
- Response time is killing their Google reviews

## What Sara Said About Syntora
- Found out about us from the CEO (S.R. Mills)
- Not sure what we already have built for multifamily
- Wants to know if we can integrate with RealPage

## Action Items
- [ ] Research RealPage API and integration possibilities
- [ ] Look at Pay Score and Snapt as competitive reference (already integrated with RealPage)
- [ ] March 4, 9:30am CT -- follow-up call with Sara + Jenny Armor
- [ ] Prepare: what can we actually build that plugs into RealPage?
