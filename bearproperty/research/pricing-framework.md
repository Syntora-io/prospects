| Buildings coming online | 72 at a time, throughout 2026 | Sara, call |
| People on application review | 7 | Sara, call |
| Admin dedicated to sorting/bucketing | 1 (full-time, 40+ hrs/week + overtime) | Sara, call |
| Leasing agents on follow-up | 2 | Sara, call |
| Assistant managers (normal duties) | 2 | Sara, call |

| Denial rate | 4-5 denials per 1 acceptance (~80% rejection) | Sara, call |
| Waiting list expiration | 90 days | Sara, call |
| AMI buckets | 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% | Sara, call |

### Full Portfolio
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current LIHTC communities | 26 |
| In lease-up | 4 |
| In pipeline | 7 |

### Madison Portfolio
- Opposite problem: not enough leads
- Staff tied up on admin work instead of marketing/lead gen
- Solving the sorting problem frees staff for revenue-generating activities

## Cost of the Problem (What Bear is Paying Now)

### Direct Labor Cost -- Core List Only

**Admin (sorting/bucketing):**
- 40+ hrs/week at ~$22/hr (WI admin avg)
- With overtime: ~45 hrs/week avg
- Annual cost: 45 hrs x 52 weeks x $22 = **~$51,480/year**
- Plus benefits (~30%): **~$66,924/year fully loaded**

**2 Leasing Agents (follow-up on sorted leads):**
- ~$19/hr each (WI leasing agent avg)
- Estimated 50% of time on application follow-up (rest is tours, leasing)
- 2 agents x 20 hrs/week x 52 weeks x $19 = **~$39,520/year**
- Plus benefits: **~$51,376/year fully loaded**

**2 Unplanned Hires:**
- These were not budgeted -- hired because of application volume
- 2 x ~$19/hr x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = **~$79,040/year**
- Plus benefits: **~$102,752/year fully loaded**

### Total Direct Cost (Core List, Application Review)
| Role | Annual Fully Loaded |
|------|-------------------|
| Admin (sorting) | ~$67,000 |
| 2 leasing agents (50% app follow-up) | ~$51,000 |
| 2 unplanned hires | ~$103,000 |
| **Total** | **~$221,000/year** |

### Indirect Costs (Harder to Quantify, But Real)
- **Bad Google reviews** from slow response time (reputation damage, lost applicants)
- **Vacancy loss** -- delayed processing = units sitting empty longer
  - Even 1 day of vacancy per unit per turnover matters at scale
  - 576 units x avg rent ~$800/mo = ~$26/day per unit
  - If automation saves 5 days per unit fill: 576 x $26 x 5 = **~$74,880 in reduced vacancy loss**
- **Compliance risk** -- manual calculations = human error = potential tax credit clawback
- **Staff burnout/turnover** -- Sara mentioned staffing challenges in Madison
- **Madison opportunity cost** -- staff doing admin instead of marketing/lead gen

### Wasted Effort on Denials
- 80% of applications get denied
- That means ~80% of the admin's 40+ hrs/week is spent on people who won't qualify
- If automation pre-screens: admin only manually reviews the ~20% that pass
- 40 hrs x 0.80 = **32 hours/week saved** just from pre-screening denials

## What We're Selling (Value Framing)

### Phase 1: Standalone Tool

**What it replaces:**
- 40+ hrs/week of manual income calculation -> batch upload, results in seconds
- Manual AMI annotation -> auto-sorted dashboard
- Delayed applicant communication -> instant auto-emails
- 80% wasted effort on denials -> pre-screen before full processing

**Value to Bear:**
- Admin's role shifts from sorting to exception handling (employer callbacks, complex cases)
- Leasing agents spend more time with qualified applicants, less time chasing dead leads
- Faster unit fills = less vacancy loss
- Better applicant experience = better Google reviews
- Reduced compliance risk from calculation errors

### Phase 2: RealPage Integration

**Additional value:**
- Zero manual data transfer
- Waiting list sorts itself inside RealPage
- Real-time processing (no batch delay)
- Scales across all 26+ communities without additional staff

## Pricing Approaches

### Option A: Monthly SaaS
| Tier | Scope | Price Range |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Pilot | 1 property (Core List) | $X,XXX/mo |
| Portfolio | All 26 LIHTC communities | $X,XXX/mo |
| Enterprise | 26 current + pipeline (37 total) | $X,XXX/mo |

Pros: Predictable revenue, scales with portfolio
Cons: Need to determine per-property or per-unit pricing

### Option B: Per-Unit Monthly
| Volume | Per Unit/Mo |
|--------|------------|
| 1-500 units | $X/unit |
| 501-1000 units | $X/unit |
| 1000+ units | $X/unit |

Pros: Directly tied to value, scales naturally
Cons: Need to know total unit count across LIHTC portfolio

### Option C: Project Build + Monthly Maintenance
| Component | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Phase 1 build (standalone engine) | $XX,XXX one-time |
| Monthly platform fee | $X,XXX/mo |
| Phase 2 build (RealPage integration) | $XX,XXX one-time |
| Monthly platform fee (integrated) | $X,XXX/mo |

Pros: Clear scope, client understands what they're paying for
Cons: Larger upfront commitment

### Option D: Hybrid (Recommended to Explore)
- Setup/build fee for Phase 1
- Monthly platform fee based on unit count or property count
- Phase 2 integration as a separate scope once RealPage approves
- Communication add-on (email notifications, SMS)

## Questions That Affect Pricing (Ask March 4 or After)

### Scale Questions
- What's the total unit count across all 26 LIHTC communities? (Not just Core List)
- How many applications per month across the full portfolio?
- How many staff across the portfolio are doing application review? (We only know Core List = 7)
- What's their average time-to-fill a unit currently?

### Budget Questions (DON'T ask directly on March 4 -- too early)
- Has Bear budgeted for this? Or is it an unplanned expense?
- Who approves the budget -- Sara, Jenny, S.R. Mills?
- What does Bear pay RealPage for integrations currently? (Anchors their expectation)
- What does Pay Score charge? (Competitive anchor)

### Value Questions
- What's the average rent across their LIHTC portfolio?
- What's their current vacancy rate during lease-up?
- How many days does it take to fill a unit currently?
- What would it mean to Sara's team if they got 30+ hours/week back?

## ROI Narrative (For Proposal)

**The math Bear should see:**

"Your team is spending ~$221,000/year on application review for one 576-unit property. 80% of that effort is on applications that get denied. Our tool pre-screens income and sorts applicants into AMI buckets instantly, saving your admin 30+ hours/week and your leasing agents from chasing unqualified applicants.

On top of labor savings, faster processing reduces vacancy loss. Even saving 5 days per unit fill across 576 units at ~$800/month rent recovers ~$75,000 in vacancy costs.

As your portfolio grows from 26 to 37 communities, this problem only gets worse without automation. The tool scales with you."

**Total addressable savings (Core List alone):**
- Labor reallocation: ~$100,000-150,000/year (admin + partial leasing agent time)
- Vacancy reduction: ~$50,000-75,000/year
- Compliance risk reduction: unquantifiable but significant (tax credit clawback = catastrophic)
- Reputation recovery: better Google reviews = more qualified applicants

---

## What NOT to Do
- Don't quote a number on March 4 -- too early, scope isn't defined
- Don't anchor too low -- this is a CEO-referred, enterprise-grade problem
- Don't price per application -- incentivizes them to limit usage
- Don't forget Phase 2 is a separate revenue event
- Don't ignore the portfolio play -- 26 communities today, 37 soon
