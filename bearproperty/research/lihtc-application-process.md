# LIHTC Application Process - Research Notes

## What is LIHTC?
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (Section 42). Federal program encouraging private investment in affordable rental housing. Properties must rent to households at or below 60% of Area Median Income (AMI).

## Application / Compliance Requirements
1. **Income Verification** - Must verify all sources of income and assets via third-party written verification (HUD-accepted methods)
2. **Tenant Income Certification (TIC)** - Must be completed, signed by applicant and owner before move-in
3. **Document Collection** - Employment verification, child support docs, asset statements, third-party verifications
4. **Eligibility Determination** - Household income vs. AMI thresholds, student status, household composition
5. **State Agency Review** - Some states (like Oregon) require compliance analyst approval of initial TICs before move-in
6. **Annual Recertification** - Ongoing income checks for existing tenants

## Why Manual Review is Painful
- Every applicant requires multiple third-party verifications
- Income calculations are complex (gross annual income from all sources, asset imputation)
- Multiple household members each need separate verification
- Strict documentation standards - missing docs = noncompliance risk
- State agencies audit files; errors can trigger loss of tax credits (catastrophic for owners)
- Waitlist management adds overhead
- Recertifications create recurring workload on top of new applications
- Staff must be trained on HUD rules, state-specific requirements

## Automation Opportunities
- **Document intake** - Digital upload portal instead of paper/fax/email
- **Eligibility pre-screening** - Automated AMI calculations based on household size + income
- **Document checklist tracking** - Auto-flag missing verifications
- **TIC auto-population** - Pull verified data into TIC forms
- **Waitlist management** - Automated prioritization and notifications
- **Recertification reminders** - Automated scheduling and tenant outreach
- **Compliance dashboards** - Real-time view of pending certifications, missing docs, audit readiness

## Key Question for Discovery
What gap exists between their current PM software and what they actually need? Are they looking for:
- A better front-end application portal?
- Automation of the review/eligibility logic?
- Integration between intake and their existing PM system?
- All of the above?
