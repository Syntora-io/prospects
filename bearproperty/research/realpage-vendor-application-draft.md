## Step 3: Application Details

**Application Name:**
Syntora LIHTC Income Calculator

**Category:**
Income Verification

**Description of your Application:**
Syntora LIHTC Income Calculator automates the income calculation and AMI bucket assignment process for affordable housing (LIHTC/Section 42) properties. The application reads applicant-submitted income data, calculates projected 12-month gross annual income across all source types (employment, overtime, tips, commissions, self-employment, Social Security, child support, disability, assets), determines the correct AMI bucket (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%), and updates the applicant's waiting list placement accordingly. The solution also flags applications requiring employer verification for tips, commissions, or bonuses, and sends automated status notifications to applicants.

**Intended use of your offering:**
Integrate with OneSite Affordable Housing to read applicant income and household data from online applications, perform LIHTC-compliant income calculations and AMI eligibility determination, and write AMI bucket assignments back to the waiting list. This eliminates manual hand-calculation of income for each application, reduces the time from application submission to waiting list placement, and improves accuracy of AMI bucket sorting across affordable housing portfolios.
