## Key Notes

### Client Needs and Technical Landscape

- Current system relies on Python scripts and PowerShell for data extraction and processing
- Main database is JST (CollectMax), manages case data and interacts with court websites
- Scripts automate pulling keyword-specific Excel sheets, distributed to teams across Mexico, India, and locally
- About 60% automated, 40% manual script writing and processing
- Centralized storage of scripts on a shared server, accessible by any team without permissions
- Lead programmers Chris and Brian are too busy to handle all coding requests
- David and Darsh seek external Python developers to support ongoing automation

### AI Discussion

- Client has not yet adopted AI but lead programmer Sean has discussed it internally
- Compliance and audit concerns remain a barrier to adoption
- Parker introduced concept of private AI system running on-premises with no data leaving the network

### Next Steps Agreed

- Discovery phase to define scope, pricing, and resource needs
- Follow-up call scheduled: Tue Feb 24, 1:00 PM ET with Sean joining
- Parker to familiarize with JST and existing scripts pre-meeting

## Raw Transcript

Cool. Very cool. All right, well, we got a good one. Today we're gonna be speaking with David Filoni Jr. Who is the owner and managing partner of Filoni Law. Yeah, I'm excited.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited. Yeah. He's not really posted that much on LinkedIn. Like you know anything about him, but.

No, I. Yeah, I just looked into their website and a little bit more into their history. So it seems like his dad was the one that started the company and then they kind of branched off and many different things, which is really cool.

Okay. Okay, so he. He emailed you or how did that work?

Yeah, no, he just booked a call. So he booked a call one of the links and I think it was a. An older link, which was really. Which is really interesting.

Yeah, I had your booking link on my LinkedIn up until now. I changed it yesterday, but. Yeah, I don't know. But. But he didn't view my profile. I never saw him as.

Yeah, I think it was. I think it was from. My hunch is it was from some pages that were on our website. That's my hunch.

Was your booking link on the pages too?

Huh?

Did you put your booking link on the pages?

Yeah, and every page has a. Has a. Has a CTA with booking link. But what was interesting about this one is that it was an older link, so. Because it says strategy call, which. That was an old link of mine that I turned off, which is interesting.

I don't know how. How would it take 10 hours again? But yeah.

Let's.

It. Cr. It.

Sent him an email. I wonder if. I'm gonna go on mute for a sec. I'm gonna give them a call, see if I can get them understanding. Yeah, he took me to a general number, so let me send him an email.

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay.

Well.

I do not think he's going to be coming, so I will send him an email. That's unfortunate, but let me see if I can get him to reschedule. If not, it's not going to be worth their time. But the good news is that something is working. I just put. I pushed out a couple more pages alongside property management, and today someone came in and scheduled the call for next Monday for property management. So something is working.

Where do you put these pages on? Or were the articles.

Yeah, they're on the website, so if you go here, there's just. There's. There has been a bunch of them. These aren't necessarily the AEO pages, So there's some in the blog posts. But there's also some in the solutions pages. Yeah, finding that specific one, I. Let's see. Let's look at the web analytics here. Okay, so it was 24 hours ago. Someone probably came in. Yeah, I'm not sure. That's what we gotta ask these people. We gotta ask them where did they come in from?

Okay. Did he book a call or was that just did.

Did. No, it's. Her name is Sarah Luster and she did book a call. She booked a call for Monday 11:30. 11 to 11:30, she said. We're looking to streamline our process on taking applications for our LIHTC communities. Right now our team spends a significant amount of time reviewing applications by hand.

What is the LIHTC government?

I'm not sure. I think that might be just a property that they are managing as far as real estate goes.

Oh, they are. Okay. Oh, these are low income housing tax credit. So affordable rental houses.

Yeah, makes sense. So they just need some sort of solution to help them manage.

Yeah.

Okay. This is, this is great. I hope they show up for the meeting. So.

No, they'll. I'll. I'll email her ahead of time and make sure that she's on the call. I was just, you know, I just. I think that I will send David an email and see if he pops on. But if someone schedules a call with you and they don't show up unless they have a valid reason, I don't. I don't even worry about it because that means that we don't want to really work with those people because if those people aren't going to respect our time, why should we put our time to help them?

Yeah, yeah, 100. Also, I changed a few things on the cold email. I mean the body of the email, this is specific to. One second, let me just show you.

Yeah, sorry that I'm more. I'm more. I'm more upset because I know that you are up extremely late for this call. So.

No.

So I apologize. That's. There's nothing that we can do on our end.

I mean, it's not your fault. It's okay. I just show you once. Okay.

I'll reach out to Sarah today and I'll. I'll introduce myself and I'll put. I'll put you on the email and say we're excited for Monday's call.

Yeah, you can see it. So this is for add properties and. Yeah, I wrote this referring to that. The article link that I sent you. Yeah, yeah. They have a lot of Articles. If there's one more, there's this one more company that does AI along with sensors for real estate that I found out. It's, I mean they are a huge enterprise and what they do is they use AI to like the amount of electricity that goes into a huge corporate building, the amount of water and all the other things that ever go into a huge corporate building. They regulate all of that using sensors, actuators and AI. Well so just.

That's really cool.

Yeah, yeah that was a, that was so cool. I read about it for so long. Yeah. So this, I have changed the entire content you could read through when you have time.

So yeah, I, I, oh, it might be a different kind of email. Yeah, it's just a notification. Okay. Yeah, I, I sent a couple of the ones that you highlighted for me. The big, the biggest thing is that I was a, I should have, I should have read it more thoroughly but I needed to reword some things because it said my name is Magna. So but I, I fixed that and I was like oh but that's okay. I really do think that this, these, that email would work because I don't know that app properties guy in that article that you sent they said they're very bullish on AI so I think that if we can get front of their face it'd be really cool.

Yeah. Also Ad Properties is like a huge house under which many other companies come. I did not know that like wherever I see they also link to Ad Properties.

Oh, oh, we got David coming in.

Okay.

Cool.

Let's see here.

Oh, there we go.

Sorry everybody. I, I'm even on hold still from this.

No worries. We understand it's a busy time.

Yeah, I was interested in your services. I have an I T team and I have a programmer and he's getting rid. I have two programmers and they're getting really busy and I was wondering what we do is we're a collection law firm and we collect debts and we use Python right now to, on our software to collect, to, to do things instead of people, you know. And were looking to see if you had writers that can do that type of stuff.

Yeah, 100% David going off the bat. We love working with Python. Honestly our whole firm is designed to be releasing Python based agents, setting up Python infrastructure for automations. That's where we're going. We try to stay away from the low code, no code kind of tools out there. But my name is Parker.

Hi Parker.

Yeah, nice to meet you.

I'm Dave Filoni.

Yeah, nice to meet you. I've read.

I have darsh with me too. Hey, programmer.

Hey, nice to meet you, man.

Nice to meet you.

And then we have Magna here, who is our lead AI engineer. Automation engineer. She is. She's awesome. And I just wanted to bring her on the call just to kind of all get familiar with each other. But. Yeah. My question is, what do the current bottlenecks? Is it just because you're looking for more hands on deck with the person.

Programming More hands on deck.

Yeah. Okay.

And then we're getting behind on, like, things that we want to do.

Yeah.

You know.

Hi.

Hold one second.

It.

Oh, I wish. I wish I grabbed more water. It's a nice day out here. Chicago magnet. It's 60 degrees over here. Oh, yeah, it's 60 degrees actually. It's crazy nice. I know that you get that weather every day, Magna, but today was a beautiful day.

Yeah, it's even more hotter here.

So.

Yeah, we're in Jersey, so it's freezing.

Yeah, yeah, I understand that. Yeah. So as far as what current Python kind of automation slash code are you currently running for your operations? What does that look like?

So what we do is we. We have a js.

Okay.

Yeah. What I will try and explain you.

Is that as you know, those.

Sam just sent me a message.

All right, I'm back.

Yeah, no worries. Is there. Is there a better time that we could. We could have this call?

No, this is good. I'm done with this guy.

No worries. Yeah. So you were explaining kind of what the kind of current architecture kind of looks like or for your operations. What does that look like?

Yeah, we have. We use a program called jst. It's kind of like our database and everything like that, and it kind of manages our cases, and sometimes we need programs for JST to communicate with our. Our court site.

Yeah, that makes sense. And as. As far as the. The need for bringing on another team member, what would that look like for them? Like, what would they be handling? What do you want us to handle?

It's just only right writing the code. So, like, so basically step in. So most of the codes that we do, right?

So.

So as Mr. Filoni said, it's by that JSD application. So when we go into jsd, a lot of, like, the paralegals, they need, like, spreadsheets on certain types of information, right? Like keywords that we use, right? So let's just say that we pull like one Excel sheet just for this. Like, let's say, what's the law word Complaints. Complaints, that collection of complaints or letters. Letters. Warrants, I don't know, something like that. Right. Some keywords and then we pull that from JST, right? And we run that automated. Like one is like automated for like every Monday at 2pm so it runs. And then when we get that spreadsheet, we like send it to like one team here or like one team in Mexico, one team india. So depending on what they need or like what keywords, we're like, we're looking.

What they're looking for is what we're pulling and then we're sending it to them. So most of our scripts are like that and then some of them are like PowerShell query based, where JST has like its own like independent filing system. So like the account numbers and file numbers, when we pull them, they have to match with our Excel sheet. Right. So one of the other programmers, he's also teaching me how to do. Because I've never handled that part yet. I'm basically new still. We use PowerShell to do that stuff where our file numbers and our account numbers in our system match the JST database. Those are some of the code that we're doing right now.

Thanks for breaking that down. JST seems like the central database that everything's housed in for the collection, I guess. System. Like how much of this process is a manual process, would you say? As far as doing the typing of the Python code and uploading the scripts, running the PowerShell queries and such, I.

Would say probably like 40% manual work. It's mostly 60% automated. 40%, we're just writing it down and just sending it and then we're just receiving the spreadsheet.

Yeah, no, 100%.

Then all of those are. Every time a scrape is ran through though, it is centralized in one part of our server where like it's in one folder. So all the scrapes are one side and anyone on like any team can access it, so they don't need any permissions or anything like that. It's just, it's all accessible.

Okay, yeah. And have you guys. I understand this is a totally separate thing. Have you guys looked into kind of private AI systems? Like, are you guys using any AIs in. In the law?

So we have not looked into that, but the lead programmer, Sean, he has been talking about it. It's just, we have to look into like the ethical and like, you know, compliance stuff like that, just to make sure that it's all. Yeah, you know, good for like the audits and stuff. Other than that. Yeah, we haven't really looked into it.

Yeah, 100%. Well, you know, that's, I just bring that up because that's one of our core offerings of our firm is setting up private AI infrastructure so that you guys would use an open source LLM. It would run on your own server, on literally a computer in the office and you would, you guys can leverage AI with none data ever escaping the building.

Yeah.

So is that stuff that you guys are also looking to like transform other than the JST database and automations here?

We are, we just, we're just moving along at a slow speed though. It's not like. So one of the main programmers, Chris, he's like really busy and Sean, he's really busy too. And. But I, what I wanted you guys for is more Chris. Chris is, Chris is kind of like versus like the. Okay, so like I want to say like, you know, like we're like lead programmers. He's like the one that makes all the programs and then he gives us like the RAW files and then when we download into our system we like distribute through like all the other systems. Right.

So there's this one program that he like specifically like makes him like, it's just really hard to like contact him about it and we're like, it's just easier to like, you know, have like someone else do it for us and at that point.

Yeah, no, I understand. Okay, so Chris, kind of top down, he creates things and he spreads them along.

Yeah, he's so busy and this other guy, Brian is so busy. So I just want to bring more hands on deck.

No, yeah, 100. Yeah, it's definitely, that definitely sounds like something we can help with. I think we would just have to understand a little bit more about what the GSD database looks like, what your current systems are, what those scripts look like. Kind of get to know your team, things of that nature. Yeah. But do you have any questions for us?

So yeah, how do you guys usually charge and how does that usually work?

Well, it just, it really depends and that's something that we kind of come up with after the discovery phase is kind of completed because we need to have an understanding of what we're getting into. And also it just depends like if we are building a custom Python based AI agent for a law firm that is going to be a separate charge by agent or if it's just an automation, it'll be by automation. And if that's like on a scheduled trigger, if you guys have it running like, I guess, twice a day every single day that you're in business, I guess, in the office, that kind of thing. Whereas this would need to be kind of more custom scopes based on what we find. Yeah.

So do you want us to fill out, like, stuff and.

Yeah, so I, we kind of. Me and Magna were kind of going to come together, we're going to come review what we've learned on this call and we're going to kind of formulate a kind of a plan of what that discovery phase is going to look like and we can kind of just come back on the next call, talk about things, talk about how the discovery is going to look like, talk about pricing, and then we can all come together and move forward.

All right.

Yeah. So is next week a good week for another call?

Yeah, I'd have to have more people on it. Yeah. Sean can definitely explain the infrastructure better. He's been here longer than I have, so he definitely has a deeper understanding of, like, the networks.

Yeah, this is.

Yeah, this was just a, like, discovery and he's written most of, like, the script code, so most of it. It should be like, the syntax should be all the same for him, so it should be easy to read.

That's fair. Yeah, no, 100%. So do we need to get kind of their schedules?

No, I, I think he'll be able to make anything that we make.

Okay, so how does Monday. Maybe you guys are in eastern time, so maybe.

Mondays are bad. He's not going to be here Monday.

Okay. Yeah, what day works Tuesday, though. Okay, Tuesday. What time works for you?

And that's 24th.

Yep.

In the afternoon, like 1:00 clock.

Yeah, that's, that's perfect for me. All right. Yeah, what I'll do is I'll send you invite to that call and then we can just add anybody's emails on and.

Yeah, exactly. Do you want me to email you the people that I want to email on there or want me to just add them on there?

Yeah, you can just email me the people that you want on the call and I can just add them as a guest.

Okay, cool.

Okay, sounds good. Well, yeah, me and Magna will get to, you know, talking with each other and we'll kind of review what we come up with and come to the next call with some good questions and a little bit more of an understanding. I might just hop in a couple of, I guess, mock databases. In jst just get familiar so I can ask more detailed questions. Okay. Yeah. But, yeah, I'll send out that email invite and then we'll go from there. Sounds great to me. Yeah. Hey, guys, it was so nice to meet you.

It's good speaking you to you, too.

Yeah, 100%. You guys have a fantastic weekend. We will kick this back off on Monday. All right, thanks. Okay, bye, guys.
