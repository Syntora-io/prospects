# Post-Call 2 Strategy Notes -- Feb 24, 2026

## Parker's Read (from debrief with Meghna)

> "They don't need another programmer. They need a centralized DevOps process. We should act as consultants first and help them securely build that infrastructure."

## The Insight
- They asked for a programmer. What they actually need is infrastructure.
- 4-5 programmers, each on a separate AWS Workspace, no shared repo, no CI/CD, no visibility.
- Adding a 6th body into that environment creates a 6th silo and doesn't fix the root cause.
- The bottleneck isn't capacity -- it's that their capacity can't compound. Every person operates independently.

## The Pivot
- Don't sell staff augmentation. Sell the thing that makes staff augmentation unnecessary.
- Parker has built enterprise monorepo structures before. This is a known problem with a known solution.
- Build the infrastructure around them while they keep working. No downtime. 1000+ court emails/day can't stop.

## Why This Positioning Wins
1. **Differentiates from body shops** -- any agency can send a Python dev. Nobody is telling them the real problem.
2. **Higher value, higher trust** -- consulting positions us as advisors, not hired hands.
3. **Creates the ongoing relationship** -- Phase 1 (plan) leads to Phase 2 (build) leads to Phase 3 (retainer).
4. **Makes their existing team better** -- David sees that his people become more productive, not that he's dependent on us.
5. **Sean and Darsh already want this** -- they were researching GitHub/pipelines independently. We're accelerating something they already believe in.

## Risk
- Trisha's security concern is real. Need to address GitHub security (private repos, SSO, audit logs) head-on.
- Chris has never been on a call. He builds the core filer programs. If he resists the repo consolidation, it stalls.
- "Big bridge to cross" (Sean) -- team consensus is required. Can't force this from the outside.
- David may still want a body. Need to reframe without making him feel like his original ask was wrong.
